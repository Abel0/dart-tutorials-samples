The source code for these examples live in the corresponding
"web" directory in order to work with DartPad.
Because these examples do not rely on dart:html,
they could just as easily live in the "bin" directory.

The one exception is the "read_file" example.
This example relies on "dart:io", so it can't be used with DartPad.
